In this game, animated bubbles float from the bottom of the screen to the top, creating a dynamic background effect. The bubbles are randomly sized and animated at different speeds for a more varied and natural look. The game board is set in the center of the page, and the bubbles vanish once they have moved off-screen at the top.

Customizing the Game
If you'd like to modify the game, here are some places to start:

Bubble Sizes: You can change the size of the bubbles in the CSS by modifying the width and height properties in the .bubbles span selector.
Bubble Speed: Modify the animation-duration property in the .bubbles span to make the bubbles rise faster or slower.
Background Gradient: You can change the background gradient of the canvas to alter the visual theme.
How to Play
The game doesnâ€™t have a traditional gameplay mechanic (like shooting or levels), but you can admire the animated bubbles and enjoy the peaceful space atmosphere!
Technologies Used
HTML5: Used for structuring the game layout.
CSS3: Used for styling the game board, bubbles, and animations.
JavaScript: Potentially used for further game logic (currently, the game.js file is empty but can be expanded to include additional gameplay features).
